To compile:
Navigate to root directory of program.
Run ant:      /Users/<Username>/apache-ant-1.10.7/bin/ant
Run program:  /Users/<Username>/apache-ant-1.10.7/bin/ant runmeJava

Notes:
  It crashes 1/100 times, and I have no clue why. I think it has to do with code from before, but I don't really have enough
  time to fix that as it is now 3:40am. If it doesn't run when you grade me can you please please please try to run it until
  it does. I know it runs it just might not on the first time.
